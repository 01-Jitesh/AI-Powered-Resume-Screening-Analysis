# AI-Powered-Resume-Screening-Analysis
This project demonstrates a practical approach to automating resume screening, highlighting the potential of machine learning and interactive web applications in streamlining the recruitment process. 
A Streamlit-based web interface is integrated to allow users to upload resumes in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT). The interface not only predicts the job category for each resume but also extracts 
and summarizes key sections (such as Objective, Experience, Education, and Skills)
